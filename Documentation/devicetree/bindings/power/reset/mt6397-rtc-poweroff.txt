Device-Tree bindings for Power Control with PMIC RTC

The power device is responsible for externally powering off or on the remote
MediaTek SoC through the circuit BBPU inside PMIC RTC.

For MediaTek PMIC RTC bindings, see:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/rtc/rtc-mt6397.txt

Required parent node:
- rtc
	For MediaTek PMIC RTC bindings, see:
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/mt6397.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be one of follows
	"mediatek,mt6323-rtc-poweroff": for MT6323 PMIC
	"mediatek,mt6397-rtc-poweroff": for MT6397 PMIC

Example:

	rtc {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-rtc";

		power-off {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt6323-rtc-poweroff";
		};
	};
